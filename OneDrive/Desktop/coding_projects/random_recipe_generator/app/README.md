# A random recipe generator.

**Goal**: The goal of this app is to create an online cookbook that allows mindless sifting through recipes and allowing users to save and quickly access them later.

**Description**:
This app will use themealdb api to get recipes and will allow users to save it in a list so they can come back and look for it at anytime. It allows users to scroll and explore new recipes which they may want to try and make and will allow them to search by category if they want to search specific recipes. This app was made for me to practice using react more and to explore react animation libraries like framer motion and using Material UI for styling.

**Libraries**:\
-Material UI\
-React JS\
-Framer Motion
